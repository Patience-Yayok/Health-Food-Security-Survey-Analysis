# Health-Food-Security-Survey-Analysis
End-to-end data analysis project focused on cleaning survey data, computing KPIs, and building visual dashboards to evaluate health service access, food security, and community wellbeing across regions and demographics.
## Project Overview
This project analyzes community survey data to evaluate access to basic health services, food security, education safety, and overall quality of life across different regions, age groups, and genders.

The goal was to clean raw survey data, compute key performance indicators (KPIs), generate insights, and build visual dashboards to support data-driven decision-making.

## Objectives
